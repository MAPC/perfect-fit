Approximately one in four multifamily residential parking spaces were unused between the hours of midnight and 4 A.M., precisely the time one would expect the highest utilization. On average, each housing unit has 1.15 spaces available, but utilizes only 0.85 spaces. In all, MAPC counted nearly 1,200 empty spaces sitting unused across the 80 surveyed properties.
