In Arlington, Chelsea, Everett, Malden, and Melrose combined, MAPC observed 1,187 unused parking spaces. This means that for every 1o housing units in the surveyed buildings, there are, on average 3 excess parking spaces. At 300 square feet per parking space, that translates into 356,100 square feet of unused space and, with construction costs at $10,000 per surface lot parking space, $11,870,000 of unnecessary spending.
