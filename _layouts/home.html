                <p>Parking is a point of contention in communities across Metro Boston, yet many<br /> deliberations about the topic occur in the absence of hard data about how much parking<br /> we have, and how much we need. The Metropolitan Area Planning Council (MAPC) has begun a<br />multi-phase initiative to develop the data and tools that communities need to establish<br />  informed, sustainable, and economical parking policies.<br /> </p>

                <p>In Phase 1, MAPC conducted middle-of-the-night surveys at 80 multifamily residential<br /> developments to measure how much parking was actually being used during the hours when most<br />people are at home and asleep. We also began to model the factors that best predict<br /> parking demand. Surveys were conducted in Arlington, Chelsea, Everett, Malden, and Melrose.<br /> </p> 
                <p>In the next phase, MAPC will collect data in Boston, Cambridge, and other nearby<br /> communities to create a broader sample and more robust statistical results. Ultimately, we <br /> plan to create online tools to support community decision-making about parking requirements.<br /></p>
