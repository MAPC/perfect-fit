We are still
working to occupy two of the 35 units. Issues may arise in the future that do not yet exist.
The property is composed of two buildings across the street from one another. The larger building
(“Building A”) contains 23 units and ~2,800 sf of commercial space occupied by a yoga & wellness studio,
and a parking lot with 18 spaces. Of those 18, one is reserved for employees of the yoga studio, and an
additional six are leased to an abutting three‐unit apartment building. The lease is the outcome of
concessions made during the disposition process led by the City of Boston DND in the planning stages of
the project, and grants the abutters use of the spaces for 99 years at a cost of $1.
As a result, 11 of the 18 spaces at Building A are available to residents. Building B, across the street, has
14 parking spaces, all of which are available to residents, but contains only 12 units. Therefore we
anticipate possibly assigning parking spaces at Building B to residents of building A. To date, however,
demand for parking by residents has been surprisingly low and neither lot has been completely
